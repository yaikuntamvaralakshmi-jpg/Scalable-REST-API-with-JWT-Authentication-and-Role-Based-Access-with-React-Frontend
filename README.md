# Scalable-REST-API-with-JWT-Authentication-and-Role-Based-Access-with-React-Frontend
This project implements a secure, scalable REST API with JWT authentication and role-based access control. Users can register, log in, and perform CRUD operations on tasks. A simple React frontend interacts with the API, demonstrating authentication, protected routes, and task management functionality.
